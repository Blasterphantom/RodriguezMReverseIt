//Mini Challenge 7 - Reverse it
//This program will take a string value and reverse it to output backwards
//Peer review - Ulises Ortega
// Review, I like Marcel code cause I can see a different to do the play again feature using a while, he also implemented for loops inside the code, very coold to see diferent code sturcture interacting together, also the math boom It's pretty the cool, the reverse for string works as well as the reverse for the numbers and the play again feature works but if I enter a maybe it finish the program.
